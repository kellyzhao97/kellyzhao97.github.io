                    <p>China’s service activity declined at a slower pace in March, as the country is controlling the
                        spread COVID-19 by imposing restrictions on business activities </p>
                    <p>China’s headline Business Activity Index rebounded to 43.0 from the record low of 26.5 in
                        February, indicating a recovery in the downturn. Though the companies is trying to lower the
                        cost by job cutting and lower selling prices, the input costs were on the rose during March and
                        posing challenges for companies’ profitability. </p>
                    <p>The Caixin China Composite Output Index rose to 46.7 in March from 27.5 of February, the
                        second-lowest level in 11 years. Despite the output and new orders were better compared with
                        that in February, the pace of employee layoffs was on record high.</p>
                    <p>The uncertainty on demand and supply chains made China's service sector experiencing another fall
                        in March. The backlog depletion rate was the quickest since September 2015. The service demand
                        was on great pressure as domestic and overseas demand plummeted. The cost for logistics was
                        rising, yet the selling price was down in order to drive up consumptions. </p>
                    <p>The long-term side effects exerted by the epidemic kept business confidence low, as the gauge for
                        future output climbed slightly from the record low in February.</p>
                    <p> “The recovery of economic activity remained limited in March, although the domestic epidemic was
                        contained.”, said Zhengsheng Zhong, Chairman and Chief Economist at CEBM Group. “Estimates
                        suggest their declines haven’t been as steep in March and the country’s first-quarter GDP is
                        likely to have dropped significantly,” he added.</p>
                    <p>Zhong also suggested the government to readjust this year’s GDP growth target and address
                        policies to stimulate consumption and infrastructure.</p>
